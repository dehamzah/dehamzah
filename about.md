Hello.

My name is Dede Hamzah. Preferred to be called ‘Hamzah’. My primary programming language is Javascript. Prefer to play role as Frontend Engineer if i'm in a team, but can go solo with JS Stack knowledge in backend. Familiar with Open edX Customization, React, React Native, Express, Mongo, Mysql, etc. Currently I work in <a href="https://www.alamat.com" target="_blank">alamat.com</a> as a software engineer.

This blog is meant to be my playground writing practice, and also my coding playground documentation. Myself, is not so good at remembering all things that i had done, so i must write it somewhere.

If you found any mistakes, bad grammar, or some typo, feel free to notice and correct me at <a href="mailto:dehamzah@gmail.com">dehamzah@gmail.com</a>.
