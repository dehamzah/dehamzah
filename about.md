Hello.

My name is Dede Hamzah. Preferred to be called ‘Hamzah’. My primary programming language is JS and use Python as secondary. I built web and mobile app using JS. Prefer to play role as Frontend Engineer if i'm in a team, but can go solo with JS Stack knowledge in backend. Familiar with Open edX Customization React, React Native, Express, Mongo, Mysql, etc.

This blog is meant to be my playground writing practice, and also my coding playground documentation. Myself, is not so good at remembering all things that i had done, so i must write it somewhere.

If you found any mistakes, bad grammar, or some typo, feel free to notice and correct me.

You can contact me at <a href="mailto:dehamzah@gmail.com">dehamzah@gmail.com</a> to ask my help or offer some freelance project.
